      <h3>Please Note:</h3>
      <p>
        Shipping costs will calculated on all non-uk orders before your payment
        is fully processed and the deliveries outside the uk mainland may have
        duties to pay before the delivery is completed. We will send you
        tracking details, but any extra costs we incur due to failures to pay
        duties will be passed onto you directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the volume of work at present please place your order through our
        webstore where possible, priority will be given to the online order,
        thank you for your consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we are slow answering the phone, its because we are either picking
        and packing parts or working in the workshop, so leave a message and we
        will try and call you back when we are quieter.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
